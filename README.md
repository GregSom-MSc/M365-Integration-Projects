# This is my Microsoft 365 Playground ðŸŒŸ

Hey there! Welcome! In this happy little space, I explore Microsoft 365 tools! ðŸš€  
This repo is all about growing my developer skills, sharing cool ideas with everyone, and being usefulâ€”mindfully and kindly.

## Whatâ€™s This About? ðŸ“–  
- Playing with Microsoft 365 goodies (like Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and more!).  
- Boosting my coding chops with fun projects.  
- Mixing my love for **finance** ðŸ’° and **tech** ðŸ¤– to create something awesome.  
- Spreading good vibes and helpful stuff for all!  

## Projects ðŸ¤–  
1. **Teams Message Sender** - Say hi in Teams! (micromanaging vibes?) ðŸ‘‹  
2. **Outlook Calendar Buddy** - Plan happy events! (become the office party-guy) ðŸ“…  
3. **OneDrive Uploader** - Share files with ease! (nice, efficient)ðŸ“‚  
4. **SharePoint List Peek** - Check out lists! (be the Karen that "knows")ðŸ“‹  
5. **Power Automate Spark** - Trigger fun flows! (begin automations!)âš¡
